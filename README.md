# Hello 🔥

This project was my very first back-end project built in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) with [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/).

I created a REST API with authentification, password hashing, and other security measures, as well as complete CRUD actions so that registered users can post and rate their favorite hot sauces. 🔥 
The database is hosted on [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) via Mongoose.

The front-end was developed by my school with Angular.
At first, I refactored the code and hosted the back-end on Heroku, but since I stopped the deployment.

## 🌶️ To see the project at work

or clone and run the project locally:
the back-end with cmd ```node server``` and the front-end cmd ```npm start```.
Then, the site should be available at localhost:4200.
